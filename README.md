# MTS - MikyTuber Shell

MTS (MikyTuber Shell) is a simple Unix shell implemented in C language. It provides basic shell functionalities such as executing commands, handling built-in commands like `cd`, `help`, and `exit`, as well as launching external programs.

### Features
- **Basic Command Execution**: Executes commands entered by the user.
- **Built-in Commands**: Supports built-in commands like `cd` to change directories, `help` to display information about built-in commands, and `exit` to exit the shell.
- **Prompt Customization**: Customizes the shell prompt to display current username and working directory.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error handling for various scenarios like command execution failures, memory allocation errors, and file operations.

### Usage
1. **Compilation**: Run the configuration script to compile the source code. If there is an error during compilation, an error message will be displayed.
   ```bash
   ./config.sh
